This copy of tinyxml2-8.1.0 is a modified version of the original.

commit 3291390336141573e51dfa991b4179c8bcd8f306
update the docs

Tag: 8.1.0

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Non-CMake build infrastructure has been removed.

- Parts of the original CMakeLists.txt that were not necessary for
  rom-properties have been disabled, including the test suite.

- Test cases are no longer built and run.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.
